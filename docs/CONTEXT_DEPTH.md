# Context Depth — the Voice & Convention layer

> Spec. The bet: **"richest context" = the model that changes the AI's output the most per token injected**, measured by output quality (did Cursor write the PR in my voice?), not by event count. Today's store is interest-centric (topics + occasional assertions); this adds the fine-grained, prescriptive layer that makes connected tools answer *like they know you*. This is the depth that the 2026-06 market check named as the surviving moat — see [VISION.md](./VISION.md), [PROGRESS.md](../PROGRESS.md).

## Principle: capture small, store distilled, serve prescriptive

Three failure modes to avoid:
1. **Spam** — storing every micro-observation forever → noise, no signal. → store granular evidence, but consolidate to a *small set of stable constants*; decay fades old habits; corrections override.
2. **Descriptive-not-prescriptive** — "interested in Rust" doesn't change output. → every served line is an *instruction for the AI about the user*, not biography.
3. **Capture without serving** — fingerprinting is pointless unless a tool consumes it. → the loop closes only at the `get_context` voice/convention packs.

## Schema — `signal.style`

New event type (alongside `signal.topic` / `signal.assertion`). Structured so it dedupes and consolidates cleanly:

```ts
"signal.style": z.object({
  dimension: z.enum(["voice", "convention", "emphasis", "format", "workflow"]),
  pattern: z.string().min(1),       // canonical, dedupe key — e.g. "terse", "no emoji",
                                     // "pnpm over npm", "phrase:and so on", "wants falsification first"
  polarity: z.enum(["does", "avoids", "prefers", "insists"]),
  confidence: z.number().min(0).max(1),
  evidence: z.string(),             // a quote or a count ("47× across 210 prompts")
  basis: z.enum(["observed", "stylometry", "correction"]),  // where it came from
})
```

Dimensions:
- **voice** — terse/verbose, hedging, directness, repeated phrases/tics, politeness markers.
- **format** — bullets vs prose, emoji, code-first, sentence length, casing ("i" lowercase).
- **convention** — pnpm over npm, vitest, no default exports, small commits, TS strict.
- **emphasis** — what they repeatedly insist on: "wants the falsification first", "minimal beats clever", "be 100% sure", "don't experiment with X".
- **workflow** — kills ideas fast, asks for the case-against, prototype→measure→delete.

`signal.assertion` kinds `preference`/`behavior` stay for free-text claims; `signal.style` is the structured, dedupe-able layer. `user.correction` already exists — wire it to write/boost a `signal.style` of basis `correction`.

## Capture — two engines

**1. Deterministic local stylometry (zero tokens, fully local).** A pass over the user's *own* messages (Claude Code prompts + chat exports — already imported) computes, with no LLM:
- distinctive repeated phrases (n-grams ranked by frequency → the catchphrases/tics)
- distinctive content words (frequency minus a stopword baseline)
- sentence stats: median length, question rate, directive-opener rate, hedging rate
- format/tone: emoji rate, exclamation rate, ALL-CAPS emphasis, "i" lowercasing, bullets vs prose, type/token vocabulary richness

Emits `signal.style` events (basis `stylometry`). This is the richest-per-cost signal available and the most on-thesis (nothing leaves the machine). **Prototype: `experiments/voice_fingerprint.mjs`.**

> **Corpus hygiene (required, proven by the prototype).** Raw human prompts are polluted by pasted data — file paths, URLs, JSON/logs, and injected blocks (`<task-notification>`, command palettes, tool output). Unfiltered, that noise *swamps* the voice signal (the prototype's first run surfaced "tmp claude 501 users" and "task notification task id" as top "phrases"). A `prose()` filter — strip injected blocks + fenced code, drop lines that are path/URL/data-shaped or lack a function word — fixed it (real tics like "be 100% sure", "industry best practices" surfaced). **This filter belongs in the importer, not just stylometry:** the same garbage currently degrades `signal.topic` extraction and the LLM profile. Fixing import hygiene lifts the whole pipeline.

**2. Zero-cost live capture via MCP.** Extend `persnally_track` with an optional `style[]` array so the connected AI — already reading the conversation — emits the voice/convention/emphasis signals it observes. No extra inference (the "Claude is the NLP engine" trick, past topics). The model is told: only emit a style signal on a *clear, repeated* tell, not every message (anti-spam at the source).

## Consolidation — distill to constants

The nightly pass (`consolidate.ts`) already exists. Extend it to:
- dedupe `signal.style` by canonical `pattern`; merge confidence/counts.
- decay: a habit not re-observed fades; a re-observed one strengthens.
- `correction` basis overrides `observed`/`stylometry` for the same pattern.
- output a capped set (~10 voice + ~10 convention) — the served essence, not the raw log.

## Serving — prescriptive packs

New `get_context` scopes, system-prompt-ready:

- **voice** → *"Write like this user: terse, no emoji, bullets over prose, no filler, direct imperatives, rarely hedges, says 'and so on' / 'doesn't make sense'."*
- **conventions** → *"Their rules: TypeScript · SQLite · pnpm · vitest · no default exports · small commits · wants the falsification first · minimal beats clever."*

Dashboard gets a **"Voice & conventions"** section (evidence-linked, deletable) — and it's a strong dashboard wow ("it knows I say 'and so on'").

## Trust

Every served line traces to evidence (quote or count) and is deletable. Stylometry is deterministic → fully auditable ("you say X 47 times, here are 3"). Honors the local-first custody promise: the fingerprint never leaves the machine.

## Phasing (smallest-slice-first)

1. **Stylometry pass** (the prototype) → `signal.style` (basis stylometry) → a `voice` pack + dashboard section. No schema upheaval beyond the one type; no tokens. *Proves the whole thesis cheaply.*
2. **Enrich `persnally_track`** for live `style[]` capture.
3. **Consolidation distillation + `user.correction` wiring** (the self-correcting loop).

## Open questions

- Stylometry baseline: rank distinctive words against a generic English frequency list, or just stopword-filter + raw frequency? (Prototype starts with stopword-filter; upgrade to TF-IDF vs baseline if needed.)
- Per-context voice: do you write differently in code vs chat? (Source-scoped fingerprints later; one global voice first.)
- Pack size: how many lines before a system prompt gets diluted? (Start ~10/pack; tune by measuring output change.)
