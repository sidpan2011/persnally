Rules:
- Cover only what the evidence supports: current work, how they think and decide, technical depth, communication style, what they care about and avoid, and non-obvious inferences the pattern reveals.
- Be specific and concrete. Where you're inferring rather than told, say so. Do not flatter.
- Every section must list the event ids (given in [brackets]) of the signals it rests on.
- The test: the person reads it and thinks "how did it know that?"`;
